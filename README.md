# HUB Individual Health

The Hub, led by Dr. Charles Plante and Dr. Cory Neudorf, will take primary responsibility for integrating the work and components completed by the Nodes in the RDC, and creating and disseminating **CSDUL**.  
It will also construct individual-level demographic variables, health behaviour indicators, and health history/health system use indicators.

Individual health behaviours (i.e., smoking, drinking, physical activity, and frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption) will be operationalized in the **CCHS** using established methods developed by **Statistics Canada** [^1]. Demographic variables, including age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, family composition, level of education, family income, employment status, and occupation, will be included.

For health history/health system use, **DAD** and **NACRS** data combined with **International Classification of Diseases (ICD)** codings will be used to identify comorbidities (i.e., the **Charlson Comorbidity Index** [^2][^3]; see also **Youngson et al.** [^4] for an application using the Canadian **DAD** and **NACRS**) and with care trajectory modelling methods [^5][^6] (specifically, state sequence analysis—which is analogous to cluster analysis, but applicable to trajectories data [^7]) to identify “qualitative” indicators of individual health history and system use.
