# Input-Output Economic Multipliers

## General Definition
Input-output multipliers provide estimates of economic impact per dollar of output delivered to final demand (final consumption expenditures, capital formation, or exports).  
The output is defined by industry according to the Input-Output Industry Classification.  
The economic impact is estimated for:
- Output  
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and its components  
- Jobs  
- Imports  

The output and GDP by industry used in the calculation of multipliers differ slightly from those published in Supply and Use Tables.  
To avoid negative inter-industry transactions, negative secondary outputs of wholesaling margins are re-allocated to the wholesaling industry and equivalently offset through an adjustment to the value of **gross operating surplus**.

## Types of Multipliers

- **Direct multiplier**  
  Measures the initial requirements for a unit of output by an industry. Also referred to as an *industry input coefficient*.

- **Indirect multiplier**  
  Defined as the *simple multiplier* less the corresponding *direct multiplier*.

- **Simple multiplier**  
  Measures the total value of production required from all industries across all stages of production to produce one unit of output for final use.

- **Induced multiplier**  
  Measures the value of production driven by household expenditures associated with labour income (e.g., wages) generated from direct and indirect effects.  
  
- **Total multiplier**  
  Sum of the *direct*, *indirect*, and *induced* multipliers.

## Type I and Type II Multipliers

- **Type I multiplier**  
  Expresses the *simple multiplier* as a multiple of the *direct multiplier*:  
  *Type I multiplier = Simple multiplier ÷ Direct multiplier*.  

  Example:  
  Simple jobs multipliers show the direct and indirect impacts on jobs of one million dollars’ worth of manufacturing output.  
  Type I jobs multipliers show the direct and indirect impacts across the whole economy of one job in the manufacturing industry.

- **Type II multiplier**  
  Expresses the *total multiplier* as a multiple of the *direct multiplier*:  
  *Type II multiplier = Total multiplier ÷ Direct multiplier*.  

  Example:  
  Total jobs multipliers show the direct, indirect, and induced impacts on jobs of one million dollars’ worth of manufacturing output.  
  Type II jobs multipliers show the direct, indirect, and induced impacts across the whole economy of one job in the manufacturing industry.

## Special Notes

- Unlike the Supply and Use Tables, the **Labour income of unincorporated sector** variable includes only an estimate of the labour income portion of *gross mixed income* (the income of the unincorporated sector).  
  The return to capital and the consumption of fixed capital of mixed income are combined with the **Gross operating surplus** variable.

- The data source for the number of jobs used in the multipliers is:

- National and provincial multipliers at the **link-1997** and **link-1961** levels are available in CSV files on request.

## Revisions and Special Considerations

- Beginning with reference year **2014**, the estimates are based on the **2019 comprehensive revision** of the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts, which incorporated revisions to both international travel expenditures and cannabis-related activities.

- Due to the **COVID-19 pandemic in 2020**, the structure of the economy was significantly altered.  
  - For analysis of 2020, use the **2020 input-output multipliers and models**.  
  - For more current periods, the **2019 input-output multipliers and models** may be considered as more reflective of current economic structures.
