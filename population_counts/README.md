# Population Counts


We used [Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts (CanCHEC)](https://github.com/csdul/pre_beta_datasets/blob/main/README.md) 2006 to create a cohort of Saskatchewanians followed from 2006 to 2016. We linked
sociodemographic information of the 2006 Census (long-form) respondents to their hospitalization data captured in the 
[Discharge Abstract Database (DAD)](https://github.com/csdul/pre_beta_datasets/blob/main/README.md) (2006 to 2016) and their mortality records in the [Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database (CVSD)]((https://github.com/csdul/pre_beta_datasets/blob/main/README.md)) (2006 to
2016). We developed an algorithm to identify Saskatchewanians who experienced a substance use harm event. We validated the cohort by comparing our
descriptive findings with those from other Canadian studies on substance use.
