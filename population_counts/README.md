# Population Counts

This paper addresses a key data gap in Canadian demographic research by providing intercensal population estimates at the Census Tract (CT) and Dissemination Area (DA) levelsâ€”geographic units frequently used in health and social policy studies due to their small size and socioeconomic relevance. While Statistics Canada offers population counts for larger regions (like provinces or Census Divisions) and for census years, it does not publish estimates for CTs and DAs between census years. This absence hinders local-level analyses, especially in studies of neighbourhood health disparities and social inequality.
To overcome this limitation, the authors compile available population data from Statistics Canada and generate interpolated annual estimates for CTs and DAs between 2011 and 2021. They also provide a detailed methodology and an open-source R script to ensure reproducibility and to help researchers perform similar interpolations for other periods or geographic analyses. Overall, the study creates a valuable resource for researchers needing small-area population data and contributes a practical tool for demographic estimation at the local level in Canada.
