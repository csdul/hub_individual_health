# CASDOHI

**CASDOHI** is a user-friendly dataset providing over **100 standardized indicators of social determinants of health (SDOH)** at the **Dissemination Area (DA) level** across Canada. The dataset is harmonized across the **2011, 2016, and 2021 Censuses** and includes **intercensal estimates (2012â€“2020)** derived using linear interpolation.  

### Key Features
- Covers multiple SDOH domains, including:  
  - Income  
  - Education  
  - Labour force  
  - Housing  
  - Ethnocultural characteristics  
- Harmonized across multiple Census years for comparability  
- Intercensal estimates allow for year-to-year analysis  

The full list of indicators is provided in **Table 1** of the [**working paper**](https://github.com/csdul/hub_individual_health/blob/main/casdohi/documents/ijpds_202405_substance_use_cohort_manuscript.pdf) associated with the dataset.
