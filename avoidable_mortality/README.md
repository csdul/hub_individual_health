# Avoidable Mortality

## Description

Canadians are among the healthiest people in the world. Policy initiatives, such as implementing universal healthcare, 
have been employed to distribute this health equally among different groups of people in the country. Yet, health inequalities still exist and,
in some cases, are growing across Canada. A key step to address health inequalities is to improve the measurement, monitoring, and reporting of 
social determinants of health, population health status, and the extent of health disparities.

The underlying purpose of this study is to provide evidence on health inequalities and how these inequalities are related to income disparities 
in urban Canada, at the municipal, provincial, and national levels, to empower policymakers in evidence-based decision-making to implement policies
to tackle health disparity in Canada.

This study was conducted in two phases. The first phase was a scoping review on the application of the concept of 'avoidable mortality' in socioeconomic-related
health inequality research. The second phase of this study was a retrospective population-based analysis, conducted in two parts; first, the 
Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database (CVSD) from 2011 to 2015 and Canadian Censuses 2011 and 2016 were used to calculate the following
types of mortality rates:

- All-cause
- Premature
- Avoidable
- Preventable
- Treatable 

They are calculated at the following level of aggregation:

- Municipal
- Provincial
- National

Furthermore, the National Household Survey (NHS) 2011 was used to measure income inequality in mortality by calculating concentration index, 
at the same levels mentioned above.
